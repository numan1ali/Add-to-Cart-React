            How this is actually works, in javascript unlike other programming languages we can apply 
            logical (&&) and operator between non-boolean values.
            Examples, Plain javascript.
            ----->: true && false
            result: flase

            what will be the result?
            ----->: true && 'Hi'
            result: Hi
            Reason: When javascript tries to eveluate this expression, it will look at the first operand 
                    and in this case its true so it will look at the second operand and Its a string and not empty (string which have atleast one character always return true)
                    so it will also give us true. Essentially we have two operands, which are truthy.
                    In that case Javascript engine return the second operand, that's why we get the 'Hi'
            
            ----->: true && 'Hi' && 1
            result: Hi
            Reason: All three operands are true, if number is not 0 then it will always be true. So, the result is the last operand, we will get 1. 

            Ps: First will be the logical condition and then it could be any jsx express.
